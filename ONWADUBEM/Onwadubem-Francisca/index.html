        <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>It is no doubt that the government of Governor Professor Charles Soludo brought about waves of changes to the great 
                state of Anambra, of which a new waste disposal system was one of it.
                The previous administration, managed waste by placing waste bins at specific places for waste disposal
                by the people and later pick up these waste using sanitation trucks. 
                The system has its own flaws, which we believe lead the new administration of Governor Professor Charles Soludo
                to come up with a new and better system for handling these waste. </p>
            <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
            <p>The working principle of the new system is that: waste trucks are moved around at unpredictable times and hours of the day, and people 
                dispose their waste when they are lucky enough. This system just like the previous one, also has it's downside. 
                The major being the uncertainty of Day and Time of arrival of the waste truck at different 
                areas/streets.
                Due to the uncertainty of the Day and Time of arrival of waste trucks, people constantly miss out
                on the opportunity to dispose of their waste appropriately, thereby leading to accumulation of refuse and toxic waste in peoples houses 
                and workplace. This is unhealthy, it is unpleasant to the eyes, it produces bad and very offensive odour and breed disease-transmitting insects like 
                mosquitoes, house flies, cockroaches, rodents etc. Others who can't bear these hazardous condition at home or workplace resort to defiling their conscience and the rule of the state by 
                disposing of their refuse at random places such as irrigation channels, express ways, major and minor roads and junctions like: Borromeo junction in Onitsha, Peoples club junction, Ugwunwasike in Ogidi, to mention but just a few. All these environmental menace end up causing blockages in the
                drainage channels which contributes to the excessive overflow of water in the water ways and roads, alternatively destroying lives and properties of which those living near these drainage areas are grossly affected. Let us recall the devastating effect of floods in our blessed Anambra land this year and the number of lives lost. These waste when mixed with water forms sludge and finds its way to many places in Anambra like Ogbaru, Otuocha, Feggae etc, and this has great capability to lead to an outbreak of another pandemic
                and pollutes the entire Anambra environment formerly known as a good home for all.</p>
        
            <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
            <p>An identified problem is useless if there is no solution proffered.
                What is the need of identifying a problem if there is no solution to it?
                The question should now be;
                how do we efficiently manage and optimize this waste disposal system adopted already by Governor Professor Charles Soludo (His excellency), so as to mitigate the problems that comes with it.
                I have good news for all especially our dynamic governor whom we respect so very much. Permit me to announce, this is where Onwadubem Waste Management Application System comes in. Onwadubem is a Waste Management Application System that integrates the principles of Geographic Information Systems  into programming to solve this waste management pandemic staggering at the face of the good people of Anambra state.
                With no further ado, Let's launch the app to see how it works.</p>

                <P> Are we ready?  Alright then, click on "APP" on the navbar, to launch the prototype of the <i>Onwadubem  </i> </P>
