<h1>when it SEEMS DARK</h1>
<p> In the begining it seemed we had the perfect life. Earle was a youth pastor, loved for his zanny humour and <strong> <em>his committment to Christ.</em></strong> I was Earles dream girl aswell.</p>
<p> God blesssed us with three beautiful daughters. Earle eventually left the pastorate to begin working for focus on the family. I taught piano lessons from our home. <!--see html dox for more, i am just expeimenting my prowess, you get the point--> God blessed us in such tangible ways-perfect timing in the purchase of a home, an incredible deal on a grand piano, a teaching schedule that is always full.<p>
<p>In the spring of 1995, <strong>our youngest daughter</strong> was diagnosed with immunoglobulinis A (<em>IGA</em>). A condition in which her immune system was not completly well developed <!--Idon come again ooo, hope say e no go show-->. so brother that is the end of my story, go and buy the women mirrow yourself. <em> <strong>Thank you.</strong> </em> <p>
